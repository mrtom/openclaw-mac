# OpenClaw Mac Mini Setup

Automated, security-first setup for OpenClaw on a Mac Mini. Based on [this guide](https://stephenslee.medium.com/i-set-up-openclaw-on-a-mac-mini-with-security-as-priority-one-heres-exactly-how-050b7f625502), with Telegram as the messaging channel and Tailscale Serve for remote access.

## Prerequisites

- A Mac Mini (Apple Silicon or Intel)
- An admin macOS account (the default account created during initial setup)
- A [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) account
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- A Telegram bot token (create one via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram)
- A [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) (optional, for web search)

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Admin Setup

Run from your admin account. This enables FileVault, the firewall, installs Homebrew + Tailscale + Obsidian, and creates a non-admin `openclaw` user.

```bash
bash scripts/01-admin-setup.sh
```

After this completes, open Tailscale and log in:

```bash
open -a Tailscale
```

### Step 1a: Dev Environment (Optional)

Still as admin, install development tools (GitHub CLI):

```bash
bash scripts/01a-dev-setup.sh
```

### Step 2: OpenClaw Setup

Switch to the `openclaw` user and run the setup script. This installs nvm, Node.js 22, OpenClaw, sets up an Obsidian vault with plugins, configures secrets, writes the config, and locks down permissions.

```bash
sudo -u openclaw -i
bash /usr/local/share/openclaw/scripts/02-openclaw-setup.sh
```

You'll be prompted for:
- Your Anthropic API key
- Your Telegram bot token
- Your Gemini API key (optional — enables web search)
- A name for your bot
- Your name (so the bot knows who you are)

### Step 3: Install the Daemon

Switch back to your admin account and install the LaunchDaemon so OpenClaw starts at boot.

```bash
exit  # back to admin
bash scripts/01b-install-daemon.sh
```

### Step 4: Verify

Switch to the `openclaw` user and run the verification script.

```bash
sudo -u openclaw -i
bash /usr/local/share/openclaw/scripts/03-verify.sh
```

This checks every item from the security checklist and prints a pass/fail summary.

## Post-Setup

### Pairing Your Telegram Account

1. Send any message to your bot on Telegram
2. You'll see a pairing code in the OpenClaw logs
3. Approve it:

```bash
sudo -u openclaw openclaw pairing approve telegram <CODE>
```

### Bot's Personality

The setup script generates a personality prompt at `~/.openclaw/personality.txt` using the bot name and owner name you provided. On your first interaction with the bot, send its contents to set the bot's personality and ground rules.

### Retrieving the OpenClaw User Password

The `openclaw` user's password is saved in the admin user's Keychain during setup. To retrieve it:

```bash
security find-generic-password -s "openclaw-user-password" -w
```

### Accessing the Dashboard

The dashboard is available locally at `http://127.0.0.1:18789/`. On first visit, you'll be prompted for the gateway token. Retrieve it from your admin account:

```bash
sudo -u openclaw grep OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN ~openclaw/.openclaw/secrets.env
```

Paste the token value into the dashboard's Control UI settings. Then approve the device:

```bash
sudo -u openclaw openclaw devices list        # find the pending request ID
sudo -u openclaw openclaw devices approve <ID>
```

### Obsidian Vault

The setup creates an Obsidian vault at `~openclaw/.openclaw/workspace/obsidian-vault/` with the following structure:

- **Daily Notes/** — one note per day (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Templates/** — reusable note templates (includes a Daily Note template)
- **People/** — notes on people, linked in tasks for delegation tracking
- **Task Dashboard.md** — aggregated task views (due today, upcoming, work, personal, waiting on others)
- **Task inbox.md** — quick capture for tasks to triage later

**Plugins pre-installed:**
- **Tasks** ([obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks)) — task management with due dates, tags, and queries

**First-time setup:** When you first open the vault in Obsidian, you'll be prompted to "Trust author and enable plugins." Click "Trust" to enable the pre-installed community plugins. This is a one-time security prompt.

To open the vault from the admin account:

```bash
open /Users/openclaw/.openclaw/workspace/obsidian-vault
```

The bot accesses the vault via direct file read/write within its workspace. No additional API or configuration is needed.

### Remote Access via Tailscale

The dashboard is also accessible at `https://<your-machine-name>.<tailnet>/` from any device on your Tailscale network.

## Managing the Daemon

```bash
# View logs
tail -f /var/log/openclaw/gateway.log
tail -f /var/log/openclaw/gateway.err

# Restart (to pick up config/secret changes)
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/ai.openclaw.gateway

# Stop
sudo launchctl bootout system/ai.openclaw.gateway

# Start
sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist
```
